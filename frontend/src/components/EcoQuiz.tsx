      answer: 1,
      fact: "Carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for about 76% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The largest source of CO2 emissions is from burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation."
    },
    {
      question: "Which of these is a renewable source of energy?",
      options: ["Natural Gas", "Coal", "Solar Power", "Nuclear Energy"],
      answer: 2,
      fact: "Solar power is renewable because it harnesses energy from the sun, which is expected to last for another 5 billion years. Unlike fossil fuels, solar energy doesn't produce greenhouse gas emissions during operation."
    },

      question: "What percentage of Earth's water is freshwater available for human use?",
      options: ["About 10%", "About 5%", "About 1%", "About 0.5%"],
      answer: 3,
      fact: "While 71% of the Earth's surface is water, only 2.5% is freshwater. Most of that is locked in glaciers and ice caps, leaving less than 0.5% of all Earth's water available for human use."
    },
    {
      question: "Which of these materials takes the longest to decompose in nature?",
      options: ["Paper (2-6 weeks)", "Aluminum can (200-500 years)", "Plastic bottle (450 years)", "Glass bottle (1 million years)"],
      answer: 3,
      fact: "Glass takes up to 1 million years to decompose in the environment. However, glass is 100% recyclable and can be recycled endlessly without loss in quality or purity."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the main cause of ocean acidification?",
      options: ["Oil spills", "Plastic pollution", "Excess CO2 absorption", "Sewage runoff"],
      answer: 2,
      fact: "The ocean absorbs about 30% of the CO2 released into the atmosphere. When CO2 dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, which lowers the ocean's pH, making it more acidic and threatening marine ecosystems."
    },
    {
      question: "Which ecosystem is considered the most biodiverse on Earth?",
      options: ["Coral reefs", "Tropical rainforests", "Mangrove forests", "Deep sea vents"],
      answer: 1,
      fact: "Although tropical rainforests cover less than 2% of Earth's surface, they are home to more than 50% of the world's plant and animal species. A single hectare may contain over 750 types of trees and 1500 species of plants."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 'Great Pacific Garbage Patch' primarily composed of?",
      options: ["Industrial waste", "Fishing nets", "Microplastics", "Sewage sludge"],
      answer: 2,
      fact: "The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is mostly microplastics - small plastic fragments less than 5mm in size. It's estimated to contain 1.8 trillion pieces of plastic, weighing about 80,000 tons."
    },
    {
      question: "Which of these actions reduces your carbon footprint the most?",
      options: ["Recycling plastic", "Using reusable bags", "Eating less meat", "Taking shorter showers"],
      answer: 2,
      fact: "A vegetarian diet has about half the carbon footprint of a meat-heavy diet. Livestock production generates 14.5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions - more than all transportation combined."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the leading cause of deforestation worldwide?",
      options: ["Urban expansion", "Agriculture", "Logging", "Mining"],
      answer: 1,
      fact: "Agriculture drives around 80% of deforestation worldwide. Commercial agriculture (especially cattle ranching, and cultivation of soy and palm oil) is the largest driver, followed by subsistence farming."
    },
    {
      question: "Which country generates the most renewable energy?",
      options: ["United States", "Germany", "China", "Norway"],
      answer: 2,
      fact: "China is the world's largest producer of renewable energy, particularly hydropower, solar power, and wind power. In 2020, China accounted for over 40% of global renewable capacity growth."
